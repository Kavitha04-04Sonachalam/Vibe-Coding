Vibe UPI Payment Demo
=====================

This small project demonstrates a UPI deep-link payment flow (INR 1.00) and includes a local SMS-confirmation simulator to help test automatic confirmation flows.

Files
- `index.html` — Simple UI: order summary, Pay via UPI button, SMS parsing helpers.
- `script.js` — Builds UPI deep-links (upi://pay) and contains SMS parsing/simulation helpers.

How to test locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser on your phone OR host the folder on a static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
2. On the page, confirm UPI ID (default `merchant@upi`) and click "Pay via UPI". This opens an installed UPI app (GPay/PhonePe/BHIM) on mobile.
3. Complete the payment in the UPI app for INR 1.00.

If you open the page on desktop, the page will show the UPI deep-link; copy it to your phone and open it there.

Payment confirmation approaches

1) Polling / Server-side reconciliation (recommended for production)
 - After creating an order and redirecting the user to UPI, keep the order in your backend in "pending" state.
 - Use the payment provider's webhook or reconciliation API (for example, your acquiring bank / PSP) to verify incoming credits for your merchant VPA or account.
 - If the PSP provides a transaction reference (merchant order id) include it in the UPI `tn` parameter so you can match callbacks.

2) SMS-based confirmation (bonus / optional)
 - On Android, it's possible to read incoming SMS messages if the app has the user's permission (READ_SMS) or using the SMS Retriever API from Google for limited verification flows.
 - Approach A (full SMS read): Build an Android app that requests SMS read permissions and looks for incoming messages indicating a credit to your account. Parse the amount and transaction reference and call your backend to mark the order paid.
 - Approach B (SMS Retriever / OTP-style): Use the SMS Retriever API to securely get messages that contain an app-specific hash. This is intended for OTPs, not general bank messages, so it may not work for UPI credits unless the sender cooperates.

Limitations and security
- UPI deep-link only launches the UPI app; it does not guarantee payment completion. You must verify the payment server-side.
- Reading SMS requires explicit mobile app permissions and careful privacy handling. For production, prefer bank/PSP reconciliation or webhooks.

What I implemented
- Frontend UPI deep-link generator (amount INR 1.00).
- Intent-based link for Android browsers.
- SMS parsing and simulator for local testing.

Optional next steps
- Add a minimal backend (Node/Express or Firebase Function) to create/record orders and poll or receive webhook callbacks.
- Create a tiny Android companion app to auto-read SMS and call the backend to confirm payment (requires Play Store policy, user consent).
